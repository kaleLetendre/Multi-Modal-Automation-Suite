# monitor the master_values.json file
# if a certain state is found, run the corresponding script
# I need a way to correlate the state with the script
# script name will be state_name;desired_value^second_state_name;desired_value.py
# format is, for each state value pair, state_name;desired_value, if there are multiple state value pairs, they are seperated by a ^, and the file extension is .py
